function neuronalDataStandardized = normalizeSignals(neuronalData)
% 
% Function: 
% â€“ normalizeSignals: Standardizes time series. Function needed in versions
%   of Matlab earlier than 2018a. Since 2018a onwards, a built-in normalize 
%   function is available.
%
% Inputs:
% - neuronalData: Neuronal time series.
% 
% Returns:
% - neuronalDataStandardized: Neuronal time series with mean 0 and std 1.
