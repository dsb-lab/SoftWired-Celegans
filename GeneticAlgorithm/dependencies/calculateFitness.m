function [meanFitness, fitnessPopulation] = calculateFitness(individualStates, neuronalData)
% 
% Function: 
% â€“ calculateFitness: Calculates the fitness of the different individuals 
%   in the population. The recorded time series are needed to compute the 
%   fitness, since it is defined as the mean correlation of the different 
%   7 neurons.
%
% Inputs:
% - individualStates: Simulated neural activity for each neuron.
% - neuronalData: Neuronal time series.
% 
% Returns:
% - meanFitness: Mean fitness of the population.
% - fitnessPopulation: Individual fitness for each individual.
